Mediachain Indexer Core is a state of the art, high-relevance, aesthetics-weighted, image search engine and reverse image search for the world's 400 million+ Creative Commons licensed images.


### Inside the models

Achieving a human-like sense of aesthetics, while balancing with the need for high-relevance results is a significant challenge. The Mediachain Indexer achieves this using the latest in end-to-end supervised deep neural networks. These models achieve results quality similar in aesthetics to the much smaller hand curated collections, while taking advantage of far larger un-curated Creative Commons resources.
